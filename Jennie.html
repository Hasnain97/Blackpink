  <h1>Kim Jennie (김제니)</h1>
  <h3>AGE: 24 (January 16, 1996)</h3>
  <h3>DEBUT: Jennie debuted as a member of the girl group Blackpink in August 2016 and made her solo debut with the song "Solo" on November 12, 2018 </h3>
  <h4>Kim Jennie better known by the mononym Jennie, is a South Korean singer and rapper.
    Born and raised in South Korea, Jennie studied in New Zealand at the age of eight for five years, before returning to South Korea in 2010.</h4>
    <h4>On June 1, 2016, Jennie was the first to be revealed for YG Entertainment's newest girl group, seven years after the debut of 2NE1. On August 8, 2016, Jennie debuted with Blackpink and the release of their single album Square One alongside double A-side singles, "Boombayah"  and "Whistle" .</h4>
    <h4>Jennie heard of K-pop while residing in New Zealand, particularly finding an interest in YG Entertainment's music. Her mother planned to transfer her to the United States in Florida at the age of 14 to continue her studies leading to an occupation of a lawyer or teacher, however, the idea wasn't to her liking as she may not find work she liked while residing alone; her family supported her decision and soon had her moved back to South Korea in 2010.</h4>
   <h4> Initially auditioning as a vocalist, the company believed she should embrace the role of a rapper as at the time she was the only trainee capable of speaking English, while most songs she covered included raps. </h4>
